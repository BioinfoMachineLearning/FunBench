                        Installation and implementation of GraphBind
                                (version 1.0 2020/04/27)

1 Description
    GraphBind is an accurate graph neural network-based predictor for identifying nucleic acid- and small ligand-binding residues on proteins.
    GraphBind consists of two modules:
    (1) Constructing graphs for residues from protein structures by integrating the local structural context topology. The residues are nodes and the spatial relationship of residues is employed to define edges. Sequence-derived and structure-derived features are extracted as node and edge feature vectors.
    (2) Hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNN), which progressively updates the graph feature vectors to learn effective latent rules for recognizing the binding residues.

2 Installation

2.1 system requirements
    For prediction process, you can predict functional binding residues from a protein structure within a few minutes with CPUs only. However, for training a new deep model from scratch, we recommend using a GPU for significantly faster training.
    To use GraphBind with GPUs, you will need: cuda >= 10.0, cuDNN.

2.2 Create an environment
    GraphBind is built on Python3.
    We highly recommend to use a virtual environment for the installation of GraphBind and its dependencies.

    A virtual environment can be created and (de)activated as follows by using conda(https://conda.io/docs/):
        # create
        $ conda create -n GraphBind_env python=3.6
        # activate
        $ source activate GraphBind_env
        # deactivate
        $ source deactivate
    OR the virtual environment can be created by using virtualenv(https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/).
        # create
        $ virtualenv GraphBind_env --python=python3.6
        # activate
        $ source GraphBind_env/bin/activate
        # deactivate
        $ deactivate

2.3 Install GraphBind dependencies
    Note: If you are using a Python virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running each command in this guide.

    Set the absolute paths of blast+ and NR databases in the script "scripts/prediction.py".
    (2) Install HHblits for extracting HMM profiles
    To install HHblits and download uniclust30_2018_08(http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/uniclust/2018_08/uniclust30_2018_08_hhsuite.tar.gz) for HHblits, please refer to https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite.
    Set the absolute paths of HHblits and uniclust30_2018_08 databases in the script "scripts/prediction.py".
    (3) Install DSSP for extracting SS (Secondary structure) profiles
    DSSP is contained in "scripts/dssp", and it should be given executable permission by:
        $ chmod +x scripts/dssp

    Note: Difference versions of blast+, HHblits and their databases may result in slightly different PSSM and HMM profiles, leading to slight different predictions.
    Typical download databases and install bioinformatics tools time on a "normal" desktop computer is 10 hours.



3 Usage

3.1 Predict functional binding residues from a protein structure(in PDB format) based on trained deep models

    Example:
        $ cd scripts
        $ python prediction.py --querypath ../output/example --filename 6ama.pdb --chainid A --ligands DNA,RNA,CA,MG,MN,ATP,HEME --cpu 10

    Output:
    The result named after "{ligand}-binding_result.csv" is saved in {querypath}. The five columns are represented residue index, residue sequence number in PDB, residue name, the probability of binding residue and the binary prediction category(1:binding residue, 0:non-bindind residue), respectively.
    The expected outputs for the demo are saved in ../output/example/.

4 Frequently Asked Questions
(1) If the script is interrupted by "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" when torch of CUDA version is used, it may be raised because the version of gcc (our version of gcc is 5.5.0) and you can try to set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to CPU before execute the script to avoid it by:
        $ export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="-1"
(2) If your CUDA version is not 10.0, please refer to the homepages of Pytorch(https://pytorch.org/) and torch_geometric (https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make sure that the installed dependencies match the CUDA version. Otherwise, the environment could be problematic due to the inconsistency.
